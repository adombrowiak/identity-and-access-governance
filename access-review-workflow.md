# Access Review Workflow

## Purpose
This document outlines a sample access review workflow used to periodically validate user access to enterprise systems. The objective is to ensure that access remains appropriate, justified, and aligned with business roles while supporting audit and compliance requirements.

---

## Scope
This workflow applies to:
- User accounts with access to internal applications and systems
- Privileged and non-privileged access
- Periodic (e.g., quarterly or semi-annual) access reviews

The workflow is illustrative and may be adapted based on organizational size, risk tolerance, and regulatory requirements.

---

## Access Review Lifecycle

### 1. Review Initiation
Access reviews are initiated on a defined schedule or triggered by events such as:
- Regulatory or audit requirements
- Organizational restructuring
- System onboarding or major changes

The scope of the review is defined, including systems, users, and access types.

---

### 2. Access Data Collection
Current access data is gathered from authoritative sources, including:
- Identity directories
- Application access lists
- Privileged access management systems

Access data is normalized and presented in a format suitable for review.

---

### 3. Reviewer Assignment
Access is reviewed by designated individuals, typically:
- Line managers
- System or application owners
- Data owners for sensitive systems

Reviewer responsibilities are clearly defined to ensure accountability.

---

### 4. Review and Decision
Reviewers evaluate access based on:
- Job role and responsibilities
- Least privilege principles
- Separation of duties requirements

For each access item, reviewers record one of the following decisions:
- Approve
- Revoke
- Modify
- Escalate for further review

---

### 5. Remediation
Approved remediation actions are executed, including:
- Removal of unnecessary access
- Modification of entitlements
- Documentation of approved exceptions

Remediation activities are tracked to completion.

---

### 6. Documentation and Reporting
Review results are documented to support:
- Audit evidence
- Risk reporting
- Management oversight

Metrics may include review completion rates, revoked access counts, and outstanding remediation items.

---

## Governance Considerations
Effective access reviews require:
- Clear ownership of systems and data
- Defined review schedules
- Management oversight and escalation paths
- Retention of review evidence

---

## Notes
This workflow reflects common enterprise access governance practices and is intended to support clarity, repeatability, and audit readiness rather than prescribe specific tooling or implementations.
