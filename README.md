# Identity & Access Governance

## Overview
This repository documents enterprise approaches to identity and access governance, focusing on how organizations manage user identities, define access entitlements, and enforce least privilege across IT systems.

Identity and access management is a foundational control domain that intersects with system operations, security, and compliance. This project emphasizes governance, lifecycle management, and decision-making rather than tool-specific implementations.

---

## Objectives
The goals of this repository are to:
- Describe identity lifecycle processes from onboarding to deprovisioning
- Document role-based access control (RBAC) concepts and access modeling
- Explore access review and attestation practices
- Align identity governance with operational and risk management needs

---

## Scope
In scope:
- User and service account lifecycle management
- Role and entitlement design
- Access review and certification processes
- Privileged access governance concepts

Out of scope:
- Directory service configuration
- Tool-specific IAM implementations
- Exploit or attack-focused scenarios

---

## Identity Lifecycle Management
This section examines how identities are created, modified, and removed, including:
- Joiner, mover, and leaver processes
- Attribute-based access decisions
- Separation of duties considerations
- Deprovisioning and access revocation timing

---

## Access Modeling and Governance
Effective access governance depends on clear access models and accountability. Topics include:
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Least privilege enforcement
- Entitlement ownership
- Exception handling and approvals

---

## Governance and Oversight
This section explores:
- Identity-related risk ownership
- Access policy documentation
- Audit readiness and evidence generation
- Metrics used to assess access governance effectiveness

---

## Future Enhancements
Planned additions may include:
- Sample access review workflows
- Example role and entitlement models
- Identity-related risk scenarios
- Access governance documentation templates

---

## Notes
This repository is intended to reflect real-world enterprise identity governance practices. The emphasis is on clarity, structure, and alignment with business and risk considerations rather than technical configuration detail.
